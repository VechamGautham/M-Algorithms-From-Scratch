# ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch

## ðŸ“Œ About

This repository contains implementations of **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch** without using libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. The goal is to understand the **core mathematical concepts** and how these algorithms work under the hood.

Additionally, this folder includes implementations using standard ML libraries for **comparison and review**.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Linear Regression** - Implemented both from scratch and using Scikit-Learn.
- **Logistic Regression**- Implemented both from scratch and using Scikit-Learn  
- **More ML algorithms coming soonâ€¦**  

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used

While the focus is on implementing ML algorithms manually, some versions also use:

- **NumPy** â€“ For mathematical operations and array manipulations.  
- **Pandas** â€“ For handling datasets.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ For data visualization.  
- **Scikit-Learn** â€“ For comparison with standard implementations.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

âœ” Understand ML algorithms at a deeper level.  
âœ” Improve coding and mathematical skills in ML.
